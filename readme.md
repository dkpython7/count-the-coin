# Coin Classifier ðŸª™

This project focuses on classifying coins using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and other key libraries. The main goal of this project is to accurately identify and classify different types of coins based on their features such as size, texture, and color.

## Features âœ¨

- **Coin Detection**: Identify and isolate coins in an image using advanced image processing techniques with **OpenCV**.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract key features like contours, color histograms, and edge detection to distinguish between various types of coins.
- **Classification**: Classify the coins into different categories using machine learning algorithms for precise identification.
- **Real-Time Coin Detection**: Capture live images from a camera feed and classify coins in real-time.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize coin classification results with meaningful statistics and charts.

## Tech Stack ðŸ› 

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing, feature extraction, and object detection.
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and numerical data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: To plot and visualize results.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrated basic models to classify coins based on extracted features
